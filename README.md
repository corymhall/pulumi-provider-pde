# Pulumi Provider PDE (Personal Development Environment)

This is a Pulumi provider that contains resources that help in configuring your
machine. For an example of how this is used see my
[pde](https://github.com/corymhall/pde) repo.


### Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed and present in your `$PATH`:

* [`pulumictl`](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumictl#installation)
* [Go 1.17](https://golang.org/dl/) or 1.latest
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) 14.x.  We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage NodeJS installations.
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (called as `python3`).  For recent versions of MacOS, the system-installed version is fine.
* [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)


#### Build the provider and install the plugin

   ```bash
   $ make build install
   ```
   
This will:

1. Create the SDK codegen binary and place it in a `./bin` folder (gitignored)
2. Create the provider binary and place it in the `./bin` folder (gitignored)
3. Generate the dotnet, Go, Node, and Python SDKs and place them in the `./sdk` folder
4. Install the provider on your machine.

#### Test against the example
   
```bash
$ cd examples/simple
$ yarn link @pulumi/xyz
$ yarn install
$ pulumi stack init test
$ pulumi up
```

Now that you have completed all of the above steps, you have a working provider that generates a random string for you.

### Build Examples

Create an example program using the resources defined in your provider, and place it in the `examples/` folder.

You can now repeat the steps for [build, install, and test](#test-against-the-example).

## Configuring CI and releases

1. Follow the instructions laid out in the [deployment templates](./deployment-templates/README-DEPLOYMENT.md).
